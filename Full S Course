# 🧠 S Programming Language — Full Official Course

Welcome to the **official, full S Programming Language Course** — the language that’s **easy like Lua**, **powerful like C++**, and made for real humans.

This single course covers **everything**:
- 🧸 Education Mode – for total beginners
- ✏️ Basic Mode – for regular coding
- 🧠 Pro Mode – for power users and performance

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run S code:

```bash
./s run your_file.s
You can also set mode at the top of your file:

s
Copy
Edit
mode: education   # or: basic, pro
If none is set, basic is default.

🧸 Education Mode
The easiest way to learn programming — less typing, more doing.

✨ 1. Hello World
s
Copy
Edit
say "Hello, world!"
✨ 2. Variables
s
Copy
Edit
name = "Alice"
age = 13
say "Hi! I'm {name}, age {age}"
✨ 3. Input
s
Copy
Edit
say "What's your name?"
name = input()
say "Nice to meet you, {name}"
✨ 4. Math
s
Copy
Edit
x = 5
y = 3
sum = x + y
say "Total: {sum}"
✨ 5. If/Else
s
Copy
Edit
age = 15

if age >= 18
    say "Adult"
else
    say "Minor"
done
✨ 6. Loops
s
Copy
Edit
for i = 1 to 5
    say "Loop {i}"
done
✨ 7. Functions
s
Copy
Edit
func greet name
    say "Hi, {name}!"
done

greet("Jamie")
✏️ Basic Mode
Balanced between easy and flexible. Great for real apps and tools.

🔁 Lists & Arrays
s
Copy
Edit
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
say colors[1]  # green

colors.add("yellow")
colors.remove("red")
🔄 For-each Loop
s
Copy
Edit
for color in colors
    say "Color: {color}"
done
📁 Include Files
s
Copy
Edit
include "tools.s"
Split your code into modules and reuse them!

📚 Math Functions
s
Copy
Edit
area = math.pi * 3^2
say "Circle area: {area}"
🧠 Pro Mode
For those who want full control, performance, and system-level features.

⚙️ Mode Activation
s
Copy
Edit
mode: pro
📦 Project Structure Example
bash
Copy
Edit
/project/
├── main.s
├── player.s
└── utils.s
Use include to organize cleanly.

🔧 Manual Memory
s
Copy
Edit
reserve memory 128

data = pointer(0)
data.write(0, 42)
val = data.read(0)

say val  # 42
🪄 Performance Tips
Use func to avoid code repetition

Minimize nested loops

Pre-load files/data

Use arrays instead of string splits

🎮 Mini Projects
✅ Try building these as you learn:

Project	Description
Guessing Game	Classic number guessing
Click Counter	GUI button + counter
To-do App	Add/remove list of tasks
2D Game	Box movement with arrow keys
Quiz Game	Ask questions + score system
⏭️ Next Steps
You’ve now learned all three layers of S:

Mode	Use For	Difficulty
Education	Beginners, schools, fast learners	🟢 Easy
Basic	Real apps, tools, games	🟡 Medium
Pro	Game engines, performance, advanced control	🔴 Harder
You’re officially ready to build tools, games, apps — even operating systems with S (someday 😉).

🧩 Future Stuff to Learn
Creating reusable libraries

Working with files and data

Game loops and frame timers

Graphics and sound systems

Real-time system tools

🎓 Final Words
S was made for you — whether you’re brand new, a game dev, a hacker, or just curious.
It’s simple when you want it. Powerful when you need it.

Let’s build the future together.

# 📗 S Programming Language — Course Part 1: Beginner Mode

Welcome to **S** — a programming language built for **everyone**. Whether you’ve never written a line of code, or you're a game dev wanting a simpler way to work, this course will take you from **zero** to building your **own scripts, games, and tools.**

## 🔰 What You’ll Learn in Part 1

- ✅ How to print messages  
- ✅ Create and use variables  
- ✅ Do math  
- ✅ Make decisions with `if`  
- ✅ Repeat things with `loops`  
- ✅ Write your own functions  
- ✅ Build a real mini app at the end  

> ⚠️ No semicolons. No curly braces. Just readable code.

## 🧱 1. Your First Line of S Code

Create a file called `hello.s` and type:

```s
say "Hello, world!"
Now run it:

bash
Copy
Edit
./s run hello.s
✅ That’s it! say is like print in other languages.

🧠 2. Variables
You can store info using just name = value:

s
Copy
Edit
name = "Alex"
age = 17

say "My name is {name}"
say "I am {age} years old"
📝 S automatically knows the type — string, number, etc.

➕ 3. Math & Numbers
s
Copy
Edit
a = 10
b = 5

sum = a + b
say "Total is {sum}"

area = 3.14 * b * b
say "Area is {area}"
You can use + - * / % ^ just like in math.

🧪 4. Conditions (if statements)
s
Copy
Edit
score = 85

if score > 90
    say "A+"
elseif score > 80
    say "B+"
else
    say "Keep trying!"
done
Use if, elseif, else, and always close with done.

🔁 5. Loops
While loop:
s
Copy
Edit
x = 0

while x < 5
    say "x is {x}"
    x = x + 1
done
For loop:
s
Copy
Edit
for i = 1 to 3
    say "i is {i}"
done
✅ S loops are simple and safe.

🧰 6. Functions
You can group code into functions:

s
Copy
Edit
func greet name
    say "Hello, {name}!"
done

greet("Sophie")
greet("Jordan")
You define with func, use done to end.

🛠️ 7. Mini Project — Guess the Number
s
Copy
Edit
say "Guess a number between 1 and 5:"
number = random(1, 5)
guess = input()

if guess == number
    say "🎉 You got it!"
else
    say "Nope! It was {number}"
done
input() reads what the user types.
random(a, b) gives a random number between a and b.

🧠 8. Challenges
Try these on your own:

🔢 Make a calculator script

🎭 Ask for the user’s name and age, then greet them

🎲 Roll 2 dice and add them

📆 Ask for the day of week and give a message

📊 Loop from 10 to 1 and print “countdown”

🛠️ Bonus: S Style Tips
✅ Use clear names: player_health not ph

✅ Don’t forget done after blocks

✅ {} inside strings lets you show variables

✅ Use say, not print 😉
